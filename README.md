# Terminal Startup Message

A simple CLI script written in plain JavaScript that displays a custom message when you open your terminal. 
It fetches your location using IP Geolocation API, and uses that to determine the
current weather using the OpenWeather API. It also retrieves a Bible verse of the day from the OurManna API.

## Features
- Displays a **welcome message** with the current date and time.
- Shows the **current weather** based on your geolocation.
- Displays the **verse of the day** using the OurManna API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- An API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- An API key from [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Terminal-Startup-Message.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Terminal-Startup-Message
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up your environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your API keys.
    ```bash
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
    IPINFO_API_KEY=your_ipinfo_api_key
    VERSE_URL="https://beta.ourmanna.com/api/v1/get?format=json&order=random"
    ```

## Usage

To make this script run every time you open your terminal:

1. **Modify your terminal's startup file**:
    - For `Zsh`: Edit your `.zshrc` file:
      ```bash
      nano ~/.zshrc
      ```
    - For `Bash`: Edit your `.bashrc` file:
      ```bash
      nano ~/.bashrc
      ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file to run the script:
    ```bash
    node /path/to/your/terminal-startup-message/index.js
    ```

3. Save and exit the file, then restart your terminal.

Now, every time you open your terminal, you'll see a welcome message with the current date, weather, and a Bible verse of the day.
